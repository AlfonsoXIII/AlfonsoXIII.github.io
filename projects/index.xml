      <description>&lt;p&gt;The following project covers the design and implementation of an electronic pcb-based christmas tree toy. The design features an audio system, enabling the possibility of enjoying several christmas classics in an 8-bit music format. Moreover, a dynamic set of LEDs distributed all across the .&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Whereas a none-MCU based solution has been preferred as the implementation approach, a brief analysis on this question is provided at the very end of this document.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;A brief explanation on the design, test and development of a simple distance detector based on ultrasonic transducers is provided. This project was carried on along with a professor from the Polytechnic University of Catalonia, as an improvement of an Analog Circuits subject&amp;rsquo;s laboratory design.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&#34;https://alfonsoxiii.github.io/projects/ultrasonic-based-distance-detector/esquematico_detector_distancia_pic.jpg&#34; alt=&#34;Overall schematic description of the device.&#34;&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;The device&amp;rsquo;s principle of foundation lies on deriving the distance at which we&amp;rsquo;re pointing to as a function of the time elapsed between an emission and detection of a signal. Further detail is properly provided in an specific section.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
